# Drug Repositioning for CNS Cancers

## Drugs Used for CNS Disease

### Drugs Predicted to Cross the BBB
[Gao et al. 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27993785) used a set of [213 drugs](https://github.com/bioinformatics-gao/CASE-BBB-prediction-Data/blob/master/1)%20Supplementary-data/TableS1-Drug-for-Train-and-Validation.xlsx) with known brain and blood steady-state concentrations ratio and their side effects from SIDER database for training and validation of an SVM model. They predicted that [110 drugs](https://github.com/bioinformatics-gao/CASE-BBB-prediction-Data/blob/master/1)%20Supplementary-data/TableS5-Total-Predicted-BBB-Positive-Drugs.xlsx) from the SIDER database have the potential to penetrate BBB.
